# IMD_Data_Analysis
These jupter-notebooks provide information and remove your confusion about the Indian Meteorological Data (IMD) rainfall (0.25x0.25 degree) rainfall data and how to process them. IMD data are provided in mm/day unit. Sometimes you need spatial plots in total annual rainfall in mm, country total rainfall in JJAS etc. These things are discussed here.
